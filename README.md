## Fantasy books website
This project is a custom website designed in my first year of computer science!

## Description
In this project, we were asked to design a custom website based on whatever subject we liked. So, my partner and i decided to center it around fantasy books! you can find summaries of these books, little quizzes that indicate whether you should read them, as well as some interactive elements such as character cards that each contain a description of that character

## Visuals
A lot of work was put into making this website look nice, however more work was put into additional details such as the hover cards, and the nice scrolling animation featured on each page, as well as the loading screen!

## Authors and acknowledgment
I would like to thank my web dev teacher Sam for helping us with this website and enduring all our questions about Javascript when it came to concepts and commands we had to research outside of class!
